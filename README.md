This repository demonstrates a common issue encountered when using catch-all routes (`/*`) in React Router Dom v6.  The catch-all route unintentionally intercepts other routes, leading to incorrect rendering or unexpected behavior.  The solution shows how to correctly implement catch-all routes to avoid this problem.  The bug and solution are demonstrated within `bug.js` and `bugSolution.js`, respectively.
